{"id":"bluefin-releases-8vh","title":"Phase 8: Research Homebrew Brewfile structure for Linux packages","description":"Analyze Homebrew Brewfiles in projectbluefin/common repo. Identify files containing 'brew \"package-name\"' entries (cli.Brewfile, fonts.Brewfile, ai-tools.Brewfile, k8s-tools.Brewfile). Document Homebrew API endpoints for fetching Linux package metadata and releases.","design":"# Implementation Design Recommendations\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n```\nBrewfile Parser → Homebrew API → GitHub API → Data Model → JSON Output → Frontend\n```\n\n## Component Breakdown\n\n### 1. Brewfile Parser (internal/brewfile/parser.go)\n\n```go\ntype BrewfileEntry struct {\n    Type     string // \"brew\", \"cask\", \"tap\", \"flatpak\"\n    Name     string // Package name\n    Tap      string // Custom tap (if applicable)\n    FullName string // tap/name or just name\n}\n\nfunc ParseBrewfile(path string) ([]BrewfileEntry, error)\nfunc ParseAllBrewfiles(rootPath string) ([]BrewfileEntry, error)\n```\n\n**Regex patterns:**\n- brew: `^brew \"([^\"]+)\"`\n- cask: `^cask \"([^\"]+)\"`\n- tap: `^tap \"([^\"]+)\"`\n\n### 2. Homebrew Fetcher (internal/homebrew/homebrew.go)\n\n```go\ntype HomebrewPackage struct {\n    Name        string\n    Type        string // \"formula\" or \"cask\"\n    Description string\n    Homepage    string\n    Version     string\n    License     string\n    SourceURL   string\n    IsLinux     bool // Has arm64_linux or x86_64_linux bottle\n}\n\nfunc FetchFormula(name string) (*HomebrewPackage, error)\nfunc FetchCask(name string) (*HomebrewPackage, error)\nfunc FetchAllFromBrewfile(entries []BrewfileEntry) ([]*HomebrewPackage, error)\n```\n\n**API Strategy:**\n- Use bulk API for initial fetch: `/api/formula.json`\n- Cache locally for subsequent lookups\n- Refresh cache daily or on-demand\n\n### 3. Release Fetcher (internal/homebrew/releases.go)\n\n```go\ntype PackageRelease struct {\n    Version     string\n    Date        string\n    Title       string\n    Description string\n    URL         string\n    Type        string // \"github-release\", \"version-bump\", \"tag\"\n}\n\nfunc ExtractGitHubRepo(sourceURL string) (owner, repo string, err error)\nfunc FetchGitHubReleases(owner, repo string) ([]PackageRelease, error)\nfunc EnrichWithReleases(pkg *HomebrewPackage) error\n```\n\n**Release Strategy:**\n1. Parse GitHub URL from formula metadata\n2. Use existing GitHub client from flathub package\n3. Fetch latest 5 releases per package\n4. Fall back to tags if no releases\n\n### 4. Data Model Updates (internal/models/models.go)\n\n```go\ntype Package struct {\n    // Common fields (works for both Flatpak and Homebrew)\n    ID                   string\n    Name                 string\n    Summary              string\n    PackageType          string // \"flatpak\", \"homebrew-formula\", \"homebrew-cask\"\n    \n    // Homebrew-specific\n    HomebrewTap          *string\n    License              *string\n    \n    // Common metadata\n    Icon                 *string\n    Homepage             *string\n    DeveloperName        *string\n    CurrentVersion       *string\n    CurrentReleaseDate   *string\n    \n    // Releases\n    Releases             []Release\n    \n    // Source repository (already exists for Flatpak)\n    SourceRepo           *SourceRepository\n}\n```\n\n**Migration Strategy:**\n- Extend existing models rather than create new ones\n- PackageType discriminator for filtering/grouping\n- Reuse existing Release and SourceRepository structs\n\n### 5. Pipeline Integration (cmd/fetch/main.go)\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n    // Existing Flatpak fetch\n    flatpakApps := fetchFlatpakApps()\n    \n    // New: Homebrew fetch\n    brewfileEntries := brewfile.ParseAllBrewfiles(\"/path/to/bluefin-common\")\n    homebrewPackages := homebrew.FetchAllFromBrewfile(brewfileEntries)\n    homebrewPackages = filterLinuxCompatible(homebrewPackages)\n    enrichWithReleases(homebrewPackages)\n    \n    // Merge both sources\n    allPackages := merge(flatpakApps, homebrewPackages)\n    \n    // Output unified JSON\n    writeJSON(allPackages)\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Frontend Updates\n\n#### FilterBar Component\nAdd \"Package Type\" filter:\n- All Packages\n- Flatpak Apps\n- Homebrew Formulas\n- Homebrew Casks\n\n#### AppCard Component\n- Detect package_type field\n- Show package type badge (Flatpak/Formula/Cask)\n- Adjust icon handling (Homebrew packages may not have icons)\n- Link to Homebrew page instead of Flathub\n\n## Configuration\n\n```yaml\n# config.yaml\nhomebrew:\n  enabled: true\n  brewfile_paths:\n    - /path/to/bluefin-common/system_files/shared/usr/share/ublue-os/homebrew\n    - /path/to/bluefin-common/system_files/bluefin/usr/share/ublue-os/homebrew\n  include_categories:\n    - cli\n    - ai-tools\n    - k8s-tools\n    - ide\n  exclude_casks:\n    - fonts  # Too many, not relevant for release tracking\n  api_cache_ttl: 24h\n  github_rate_limit_delay: 1s\n```\n\n## Phased Rollout\n\n### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)\n1. Parse cli.Brewfile and ai-tools.Brewfile only (~40 packages)\n2. Fetch metadata for homebrew-core packages only\n3. Extract GitHub releases where available\n4. Display alongside Flatpak apps with \"Formula\" badge\n5. Basic filtering by package type\n\n### Phase 2: Full Coverage\n1. Parse all 12 Brewfiles (~155 packages)\n2. Support custom tap packages\n3. Add cask support\n4. Enhanced filtering (by Brewfile category)\n\n### Phase 3: Polish\n1. Homebrew package icons (via GitHub repo avatars?)\n2. Analytics integration (Homebrew install stats)\n3. Dependency visualization\n4. Change tracking (monitor Brewfile commits)\n\n## Open Questions for Implementation\n\n1. **Brewfile Location:**\n   - Clone bluefin-common as git submodule?\n   - Hardcode path assumption?\n   - Make configurable via env var?\n\n2. **Custom Tap Handling:**\n   - Start with homebrew-core only?\n   - Add custom tap support later?\n   - Manual package list for custom taps?\n\n3. **Icon Strategy:**\n   - Use generic package icon for all Homebrew?\n   - Fetch GitHub repo avatar?\n   - Fetch from formula homepage?\n   - Skip icons entirely?\n\n4. **Rate Limits:**\n   - GitHub API: 60 req/hour (unauthenticated), 5000/hour (authenticated)\n   - Strategy: Cache aggressively, use conditional requests\n   - Consider GitHub App for higher limits\n\n5. **Build Time:**\n   - Adding 116 packages = 116+ API calls\n   - Estimate: ~2-3 minutes for full fetch\n   - Solution: Parallel fetching with rate limiting\n","notes":"# Homebrew Brewfile Research - Complete Findings\n\n## Repository Structure\n**Location:** ~/src/bluefin-common/system_files/\n**Path Pattern:** {shared,bluefin}/usr/share/ublue-os/homebrew/*.Brewfile\n\n## Brewfiles Inventory (12 files total, 520 lines)\n\n### Shared Brewfiles\n1. **cli.Brewfile** (20 lines) - CLI tools (atuin, bat, eza, fd, gh, ripgrep, starship, zoxide, etc.)\n2. **fonts.Brewfile** (11 lines) - Nerd Fonts (caskaydia-mono, jetbrains-mono, fira-code, etc.)\n3. **ai-tools.Brewfile** (24 lines) - AI/ML tools (aichat, opencode, llm, mods, ramalama, whisper-cpp)\n4. **k8s-tools.Brewfile** (14 lines) - Kubernetes tools (kind, kubectl, k9s, helm, kubectx)\n5. **ide.Brewfile** (9 lines) - IDEs and editors (vscode, vscodium, nvim, micro, helix, devcontainer)\n6. **experimental-ide.Brewfile** (13 lines) - Experimental IDE packages\n7. **swift.Brewfile** (9 lines) - Swift development tools\n8. **cncf.Brewfile** (300 lines) - CNCF projects (89 formulas: graduated, incubating, sandbox)\n9. **artwork.Brewfile** (7 lines) - Wallpapers and artwork casks\n\n### Bluefin-Specific Brewfiles\n10. **system-flatpaks.Brewfile** (38 lines) - Flatpak apps for main system\n11. **system-dx-flatpaks.Brewfile** (6 lines) - Flatpak apps for DX variant\n12. **full-desktop.Brewfile** (69 lines) - Full desktop environment packages\n\n## Package Type Distribution\n\n### Brew Formulas (116 unique packages)\n- CLI tools and command-line applications\n- Developer tools and build systems\n- Cloud-native/Kubernetes tools\n- AI/ML command-line tools\n\n**Examples:**\n- brew \"atuin\"\n- brew \"bat\"\n- brew \"ripgrep\"\n- brew \"kubectl\"\n- brew \"helm\"\n- brew \"anomalyco/tap/opencode\" (custom tap)\n- brew \"ublue-os/experimental-tap/linux-mcp-server\" (custom tap)\n\n### Casks (39 unique packages)\n- Desktop applications\n- Fonts (Nerd Fonts variants)\n- IDEs and GUI editors\n- Wallpaper collections\n- Custom Linux-specific casks\n\n**Examples:**\n- cask \"font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font\"\n- cask \"claude-code\"\n- cask \"ublue-os/tap/visual-studio-code-linux\"\n- cask \"ublue-os/tap/goose-linux\"\n- cask \"bluefin-wallpapers\"\n\n### Taps (17 unique taps)\nCustom Homebrew repositories for packages not in homebrew-core\n\n**Examples:**\n- tap \"ublue-os/tap\"\n- tap \"ublue-os/experimental-tap\"\n- tap \"anomalyco/tap\"\n- tap \"charmbracelet/tap\"\n- tap \"k0sproject/tap\"\n- tap \"buildpacks/tap\"\n\n### Flatpak Entries (embedded in Brewfiles)\nSome Brewfiles include flatpak entries mixed with brew/cask\n\n**Examples:**\n- flatpak \"ai.jan.Jan\"\n- flatpak \"io.kinvolk.Headlamp\"\n- flatpak \"io.podman_desktop.PodmanDesktop\"\n\n## Brewfile Syntax Patterns\n\n```ruby\n# Standard homebrew-core formula\nbrew \"package-name\"\n\n# Custom tap formula\nbrew \"tap-owner/tap-name/package-name\"\n\n# Cask (desktop app or font)\ncask \"cask-name\"\n\n# Custom tap cask\ncask \"tap-owner/tap-name/cask-name\"\n\n# Tap declaration\ntap \"owner/repo-name\"\ntap \"owner/repo-name\", \"https://github.com/owner/repo.git\"\n\n# Flatpak (non-standard, bluefin-specific)\nflatpak \"app.id.Name\"\n\n# Comments\n# Single line comment\n```\n\n## Homebrew API Endpoints\n\n### Official Homebrew API (formulae.brew.sh)\n\n#### 1.

Clone tap repos and parse Ruby formula files\n2. Use GitHub API to fetch formula files from tap repos\n3. Query `brew info --json \u003cformula\u003e` locally (requires local Homebrew install)\n4. Maintain a manual list of custom tap packages\n\n## Release/Changelog Strategy\n\n### For homebrew-core packages:\n1. Extract GitHub URL from `urls.stable.url` or `urls.head.url`\n2. Parse GitHub owner/repo from URL\n3. Use GitHub Releases API: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases`\n4. Fall back to tags if no releases: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/tags`\n\n### For custom tap packages:\n1. Fetch formula file from tap repo (GitHub raw content)\n2. Parse Ruby DSL to extract version and source URL\n3. Follow same GitHub release strategy if source is GitHub\n4. Otherwise use version changes in tap commits\n\n### Version Update Detection:\nMonitor Brewfile changes in bluefin-common repo:\n- Track commits to `system_files/**/*.Brewfile`\n- Diff brew/cask entries between commits\n- Detect version bumps in quoted package specs\n\n## Implementation Recommendations\n\n### Phase 1: Core Package Support\n1. Parse all Brewfiles to extract brew/cask entries\n2. Fetch metadata for homebrew-core packages via API\n3. Extract GitHub URLs and fetch release data\n4. Filter for Linux-compatible packages (`bottle.files` contains `*_linux`)\n\n### Phase 2: Custom Tap Support\n1. Identify custom tap packages (contain \"/\")\n2. Fetch formula files from tap GitHub repos\n3. Parse Ruby DSL or use local `brew info --json`\n4. Extract version and changelog data\n\n### Phase 3: Integration\n1. Merge Homebrew data with existing Flatpak data\n2. Add package_type field: \"flatpak\", \"brew\", \"cask\"\n3. Unified sorting/filtering across package types\n4. Display Homebrew packages alongside Flatpak apps\n\n## Key Files for Parser Implementation\n\n```go\n// Example Brewfile parser targets\n/var/home/jorge/src/bluefin-common/system_files/shared/usr/share/ublue-os/homebrew/cli.Brewfile\n/var/home/jorge/src/bluefin-common/system_files/shared/usr/share/ublue-os/homebrew/ai-tools.Brewfile\n/var/home/jorge/src/bluefin-common/system_files/bluefin/usr/share/ublue-os/homebrew/full-desktop.Brewfile\n```\n\n## Sample API Calls\n\n```bash\n# Get all formulas (large response ~50MB)\ncurl https://formulae.brew.sh/api/formula.json\n\n# Get specific formula\ncurl https://formulae.brew.sh/api/formula/ripgrep.json\n\n# Get all casks\ncurl https://formulae.brew.sh/api/cask.json\n\n# Get specific cask\ncurl https://formulae.brew.sh/api/cask/visual-studio-code.json\n```\n\n## Next Steps (Phase 9/10)\n\n1. **Parse Brewfiles** - Create Go parser for Brewfile syntax\n2. **Fetch Metadata** - Query Homebrew API for package details\n3. **Extract Releases** - Parse GitHub URLs and fetch release data\n4. **Data Model** - Extend models.go to support Homebrew packages\n5. **Merge Data** - Combine with existing Flatpak pipeline\n6. **UI Updates** - Display Homebrew packages in frontend\n\n## Blockers \u0026 Questions\n\n1. **Custom Tap Access:** How to handle packages from private/custom taps?\n   - Option A: Clone tap repos locally\n   - Option B: Maintain manual package list\n   - Option C: Require local Homebrew install\n\n2. **Changelog Source:** Where do we get changelogs?\n   - GitHub Releases (when available)\n   - Homebrew formula version history (Git commits)\n   - Package project's own changelog files\n\n3. **Update Frequency:** How often to refresh Homebrew data?\n   - Real-time: Query API on every build\n   - Cached: Store snapshot and refresh periodically\n   - Hybrid: Cache with TTL\n\n4. **Scope:** Which Brewfiles to include?\n   - All 12 Brewfiles (116+ packages)?\n   - Only certain categories (cli, ai-tools, k8s)?\n   - User-configurable selection?\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jorge.castro@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-02T21:04:02.306265875-05:00","created_by":"Jorge O.

{"id":"bluefin-releases-r8v","title":"Investigate using font awesome for the appcards","notes":"## Font Awesome Investigation Findings\n\n### 1. Current Icon Implementation\n\nThe app cards currently use a **mixed approach** for icons:\n\n- **Flatpak apps**: External PNG icons from Flathub CDN (128x128px images)\n  - Example: `https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/gnome/Calculator/.../icons/128x128/org.gnome.Calculator.png`\n- **Homebrew packages**: Emoji fallback (🍺 beer mug emoji)\n- **OS releases**: Emoji fallback (🐧 penguin emoji)\n- **Source repo indicators**: Emoji icons (⚙ for GitHub, 🌐 for web)\n- **Verified badge**: Unicode checkmark (✓)\n- **Favorites**: Star emoji (⭐)\n\n**Current code locations:**\n- `src/components/AppCard.astro` (lines 112-120, 216-217, 131-133, 201)\n\n### 2. Font Awesome Integration Options\n\n#### Option A: CDN Integration (Recommended)\n**Pros:**\n- Zero build configuration\n- No npm dependencies\n- Instant setup (add `\u003clink\u003e` or `\u003cscript\u003e` tag)\n- Always up-to-date with Font Awesome CDN\n- Free tier includes 1,500+ icons\n\n**Cons:**\n- External dependency (requires internet)\n- Potential GDPR/privacy concerns (CDN tracking)\n- Less control over caching\n- Free tier has rate limits\n\n**Implementation:**\nAdd to `src/pages/index.astro` `\u003chead\u003e`:\n```html\n\u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.1/css/all.min.css\" /\u003e\n```\n\n#### Option B: NPM Package (Self-hosted)\n**Pros:**\n- No external dependencies\n- Full control over bundle\n- No privacy concerns\n- No rate limits\n- Can tree-shake unused icons\n\n**Cons:**\n- Increases bundle size (~50-200KB depending on usage)\n- Requires build configuration\n- Need to manually update\n- More complex setup for icon subsets\n\n**Implementation:**\n```bash\nnpm install @fortawesome/fontawesome-free\n```\n\nThen import in Astro component or add to build process.\n\n### 3. Benefits vs Current Approach\n\n#### Benefits of Font Awesome:\n✅ **Consistency**: Professional, unified icon style\n✅ **Scalability**: Vector icons scale perfectly at any size\n✅ **Color control**: Easy to theme with CSS\n✅ **Accessibility**: Better screen reader support with proper aria labels\n✅ **Variety**: 1,500+ free icons (beer, package, code, check-circle, star, etc.)\n✅ **No emoji issues**: Cross-platform consistency (emojis look different on different OS)\n✅ **Professional appearance**: More polished than emojis\n\n#### Drawbacks:\n❌ **External icons unaffected**: Flatpak icons from Flathub would remain as-is\n❌ **Limited scope**: Only replaces fallback icons and decorative elements\n❌ **Bundle size**: Adds 50-200KB to page load (CDN) or bundle (npm)\n❌ **Learning curve**: Team needs to learn FA class names\n\n### 4. Implementation Effort Estimate\n\n#### For CDN approach:\n- **Setup**: 5 minutes (add CDN link)\n- **Replace emojis**: 15-30 minutes\n  - Homebrew icon: `\u003ci class=\"fa-solid fa-beer-mug-empty\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e` or `fa-box`\n  - OS icon: `\u003ci class=\"fa-brands fa-linux\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e` or `fa-fedora`\n  - GitHub icon: `\u003ci class=\"fa-brands fa-github\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e`\n  - Web icon: `\u003ci class=\"fa-solid fa-globe\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e`\n  - Verified badge: `\u003ci class=\"fa-solid fa-circle-check\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e`\n  - Star: `\u003ci class=\"fa-solid fa-star\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e`\n- **CSS adjustments**: 10-15 minutes (size, color, spacing)\n- **Testing**: 10 minutes (verify all icons render correctly)\n- **Total**: ~40-60 minutes\n\n#### For NPM approach:\n- **Setup \u0026 config**: 30-45 minutes (install, configure, tree-shaking)\n- **Implementation**: Same as above (15-30 minutes)\n- **Testing**: Same as above (10 minutes)\n- **Total**: ~55-85 minutes\n\n### 5. Recommendation\n\n**✅ PROCEED with Font Awesome CDN approach**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1. **Low effort, high impact**: 40-60 minutes for a more professional appearance\n2. **Emoji consistency issues**: Current emojis (🍺🐧⚙) render differently across platforms\n3. **Scalability**: Better for future icon needs\n4. **CDN vs NPM**: CDN is simpler for this use case; the site already loads external images from Flathub CDN\n\n**Suggested icons:**\n- Homebrew: `fa-solid fa-beer-mug-empty` or `fa-solid fa-box-open`\n- OS releases: `fa-brands fa-linux` or `fa-brands fa-fedora`\n- GitHub repos: `fa-brands fa-github`\n- Web repos: `fa-solid fa-globe`\n- Verified: `fa-solid fa-circle-check` (green)\n- Favorites: `fa-solid fa-star` (yellow/gold)\n\n**Next steps:**\n1. Add Font Awesome CDN link to `\u003chead\u003e`\n2. Replace emoji strings in AppCard.astro with FA `\u003ci\u003e` tags\n3. Update CSS for icon sizing and colors\n4. Test across light/dark themes","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jorge.castro@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-02T22:53:20.803977832-05:00","created_by":"Jorge O.

Recommendation: PROCEED with Font Awesome CDN integration.\n\nKey findings:\n• Current implementation uses mixed icons (Flathub CDNs, emojis, unicode)\n• Emojis render inconsistently across platforms\n• Font Awesome would provide professional, scalable vector icons\n• CDN approach is simplest: ~40-60 min implementation\n• Primary use: Replace emoji fallbacks (🍺🐧⚙✓⭐) with proper icons\n• External Flatpak icons from Flathub would remain unchanged\n\nEstimated impact: Low effort (1 hour), moderate visual improvement, better cross-platform consistency.\n\nSee detailed notes for implementation plan and suggested icons."}
